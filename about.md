Hi, I am Akshay Sanjeev, a grad student at Institute of Mathematical Science(IMSc). Chennai.
I am interested in Complex systems in biology. I like to take pictures. I am a Malayali. 
I read fiction and non-fiction in Malayalam and sometimes English as well. I am politically inclined towards Marxism and Socialism. I like video games, mechanical keyboards, LaTeX and pretty much everything, if you have the time and patience to explain it to me. When I am bored, I have a boarder-line youtube addiction. I am also a quizzer. I listen to malayalam film, carnatic and rock music.
